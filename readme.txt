Summary:
The Boulder to Yale Trail is a text based rpg game that utilizes a graph class to travel
the highways of America to get from CU Boulder to Yale. The character has several stats
that help them on the way. The Graph is weighted and when you travel over a road, gas is
deducted from your tank as you drive more and more miles. The graph class also includes the use
of road names and state names. How soon you get to your destination and the how much money
you used determines your final score. In order to use the program simply follow along with
the given prompts. 

Depedencies:
A 32 or 64 bit operating system
standard libraries such as: iostream, cstdlib, string, and vector
a compiler like mingw
a linker
thats about it, no specific system requirements!

No additional contributors

open issues: Sometimes the menu generates big chunks of white space when you buy gas or mess around with different inputs. Also 
some inputs do not account for characters entered and characters entered will crash the program.
